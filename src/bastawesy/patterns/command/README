The Command Pattern :
    Allow you to decouple the requester of an action from the object that actually performs the action.


The CLIENT object (RemoteControlTest) ;
    create the required command object and passes it to the invoker object by calling the setCommand() method of
    the current invoker.


The COMMAND object (LightOnCommand, LightOffCommand) :
    Encapsulates a request to do something on a specific object (receiver object).
    It implements the command interface which contains execute() method whose implementation will contain
    the actions to be performed on the receiver.


The RECEIVER object (Light) :
    provide the needed actions to be called from the command object.


The INVOKER object (SimpleRemoteControl) :
    contains setCommand() method which simply set a given command object to the current command object.
    It also used the current command object to execute required actions by calling execute() method of
    current command object.
